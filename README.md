This classifier was developed as part of a larger, collaborative emotion-recognition project. The original dataset had 7 emotions, 
which I reclassified into 3 categories (positive, neutral, negative), and then trained a classification model on.

Original dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio 

The audio is converted into MFCC data, which is then fed into a convolutional neural network for classification. 

In this repository, I have included the training script along with a pretrained model.
